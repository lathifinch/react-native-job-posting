## Prerequiste

- ReactNative
- Redux

## Definition

- [x] ReactNative: React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [x] Redux: Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience.

   `$ git clone https://github.com/lathifinch/react-native-job-posting.git`

2. Install depedencies
